## Introduction
This malware sample was analyzed to understand its behavior, impacts, and potential risks to system security. The analysis was performed in a fully isolated virtual environment to prevent unintended malware propagation. This report outlines the detailed observations and provides best practices for defending against similar malware infections.

## Environment Setup
To ensure the malware was analyzed safely, the analysis was performed in an isolated environment using **VMware**. The environment was kept offline and disconnected from any network to prevent the malware from spreading or interacting with external systems.

### Operating System
- **Windows 10** (Isolated Virtual Machine)

### Tools Used
The following tools were utilized during the analysis:
- **IDA Pro:** For reverse engineering and static code analysis of the malware.
- **OllyDbg:** For live debugging of the malware while running in a safe environment.
- **Process Monitor:** To monitor real-time system changes, such as file and registry modifications.
- **Wireshark:** For capturing and analyzing network traffic initiated by the malware.

## Static Analysis
Static analysis was performed without running the malware, focusing on dissecting its structure and characteristics.

### File Information
- **File Type:** Executable (.exe)
- **File Size:** 512 KB
- **File Hash (SHA-256):** `abcd1234efgh5678ijklmnopqrstuvwx` (used to verify the file's integrity)

#### Notable Observations:
- The executable contains obfuscated strings, indicating attempts to hide its true purpose.
- Detected suspicious API calls associated with registry manipulation and process injection.

## Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis was performed by executing the malware within the controlled environment to observe its behavior in real time.

### System Changes
The malware exhibited the following behavior during execution:
- **Registry Modifications:** Altered several critical registry entries, potentially to ensure persistence across system reboots.
- **Disabled Security Features:** The malware attempted to disable Windows Defender and other built-in security features.
- **File Alterations:** Created new files in the system directories and attempted to replace existing system files with malicious versions.

### Network Activity
During execution, the malware attempted to establish connections to external servers:
- **IP Addresses:** Multiple connection attempts to IP addresses in **Russia** and **China** were detected.
- **Domain Names:** The malware attempted to contact several suspicious domains, which were identified as part of a known botnet.
- **Data Transmission:** Evidence suggests that the malware was attempting to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as system information and user credentials.

## Findings and Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to mitigate the threat posed by the analyzed malware:

### System Restoration
- **Restore System Files:** Run integrity checks on system files using tools like `sfc /scannow` and restore altered files.
- **Registry Cleanup:** Use registry tools or manual intervention to revert any unauthorized changes made by the malware.

### Network Security
- **Block Malicious IPs:** Ensure the IP addresses and domains the malware tried to contact are blocked at the firewall or IDS/IPS level.
- **Monitor Traffic:** Keep an eye on unusual network traffic from the infected systems to external servers.

### General Recommendations
- **Keep Systems Updated:** Ensure that antivirus software, firewalls, and all other security measures are updated regularly.
- **User Awareness:** Educate users on recognizing phishing emails and malicious downloads to prevent initial infection.
- **Application Whitelisting:** Consider implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized executables from running.
- **Backup and Recovery Plans:** Regular backups should be maintained and tested for effective disaster recovery.

## Conclusion
The analyzed malware sample demonstrated advanced capabilities in system modification, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration attempts. Immediate remediation steps should focus on restoring altered system files, blocking malicious network activity, and reinforcing security measures to prevent future infections. Implementing the outlined recommendations will reduce the risk of similar threats.

## Appendix

### Hash Verification
To verify the integrity of the malware sample, the following hash can be used for comparison:
